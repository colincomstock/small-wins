# AddUp
A habit tracker and encouragement mechanism built for my own tendencies to help me get closer to the ideal me.

## Overview
AddUp is designed to help users track their habits and provide encouragement along the way. By focusing on small wins, users can build momentum that "adds up" over time, making it easier to achieve their goals and become the best version of themselves. The concept is based on rewarding individual contributions to a larger goal, rather than idolizing a final outcome that can be intimidating when you're not already there. This tool is the result of me not bonding with many other existing paradigms for tracking habits and tasks and goals, and just deciding to make my own.

## Features
- Task Monitoring: Easily track all of the tasks you have to do each day
- Habit Tracking: Monitor your progress on specific habits over time
- Customizable Goals: Set and adjust your goals based on your personal preferences and progress
- Weekly Summary: Get an AI driven weekly summary on your performance that week, how it stacks up to your average week, and personalized tips for improvement.
- Daily Journalling: Reflect on your day, jot down your thoughts, and track your emotional well-being over time. Get the chance to enter in anything you forgot to record during your day

## Additional Notes
This tool is very much a work in progress, and a structured exercise to help me gain more familiarity with various libraries and frameworks in the JavaScript ecosystem. As I continue to develop and refine AddUp, I hope to incorporate user feedback and iterate on the design to better meet the needs of those who choose to use it, if any.
